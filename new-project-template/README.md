New project template
====================

This directory contains an example of a CodeChat Editor project. To create a new
project using this template:

1.  Copy this file and [toc.md](toc.md) to a newly-created directory of your
    choice.
2.  Browse to the directory you just created using the CodeChat Editor's
    web-based file browser.
3.  Open this file and start editing. (If you don't want a readme file, you may
    delete it; only [toc.md](toc.md)  is required for a CodeChat Editor
    project.) You may add any source files you like in this directory or in any
    subdirectory. When you add or delete a file, update the [table of
    contents](toc.md) to make navigation easier.
