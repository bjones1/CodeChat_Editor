# CodeChat Editor overview

The CodeChat Editor is a GUI-based programmer's word processor / Jupyter for
software developers. This document records its overall design.

## <a id="how-to-run"></a>How to run

The [CodeChat Editor repository](https://github.com/bjones1/CodeChat_Editor)
contains the code for this application. Either
[download the latest release](https://github.com/bjones1/CodeChat_Editor/releases)
or (better) build from source.

### To build from source

1.  Clone or download the repository.
2.  [Install the Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). I
    recommend the 64-bit toolset for Windows.
3.  [Install NPM](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)
    (the Node.js package manager).
4.  Install all NPM dependencies: in the `client/` directory, run `npm update`.
5.  Package all JavaScript dependencies from NPM: also in the `client/`
    directory, run `npm run build`.
6.  In the `server/` directory, execute `cargo run`.
7.  Open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.
8.  Open the file `README.md`.

## <a id="vision"></a>Vision

These form a set of high-level requirements to guide the project.

- View source code as
  <a id="vision-code-blocks-and-doc-blocks"></a>[code blocks and doc blocks](index.md#code-blocks-and-doc-blocks).
  Doc blocks are lines of source which contain only correctly-formatted
  comments.
- Provide support for a
  <a id="vision-programming-language-support"></a>[wide variety of programming languages](index.md#programming-language-support).
- Provide integration with a
  <a id="vision-ide-integration"></a>[wide variety of IDEs/text editors](index.md#ide-integration).
- Load a document from source code, allow edits in a GUI, then save it back to
  source code.
  - Provide word processor GUI tools (insert hyperlink, images, headings, change
    font, etc.) for doc blocks.
  - Provide text editor/IDE tools (syntax highlighting, line numbers, show
    linter feedback) for code blocks.
- Zero build: eliminate the traditional project build process -- make it almost
  instantaneous.
- Doc block markup should be readable and well-known: markdown.
- Support both a single-file mode and a project mode.
  - A project is a specific directory tree, identified by the presence of a TOC.
    A TOC is just a plain Markdown file with a specific name.
  - A page in a project build is a single-file page plus:
    - A TOC, along with previous/next/up navigation. The TOC is synchronized to
      the current page.
    - Numbering comes from the current page's location within the TOC. Pages not
      in the TOC aren't numbered.
- <a id="authoring-support"></a>Provide
  [authoring support](index.md#authoring-support), which allows authors to
  easily create book/project-like features. In particular:
  - Counters for numbering figures, tables, equations, etc. All counters are
    page-local (no global counters).
  - Auto-titled links: the link text is automatically derived from the link's
    destination (the heading text at the link's destination; a figure/table
    caption, etc.).
  - Auto-generated back links: anchors support auto-generated links back to all
    their referents, which can be used for footnotes, endnotes, citations, and
    indices. To enable this, all forward links must include an anchor and
    optionally the text to display at the target.
  - TOC support which, given some file(s), expands to a nested list of headings
    in the file(s). Authors may specify the depth of headings to include.
  - Autogenerated anchors for all anchors (headings, hyperlinks, etc.)
  - Hyperlinks to identifiers in code (use
    [ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags)).
  - Substitutions.
  - Files/anchors can be freely moved without breaking links. This requires all
    anchors to be globally unique. HTML allows upper/lowercase ASCII plus the
    hyphen and underscore for IDs, meaning that a 5-character string
    provides >250 million unique anchors.
- Make picking a file/anchor easy: provide a searchable, expanded TOC listing
  every anchor.
- Provide edit and view options. (Rely on an IDE to edit raw source.)

### Nice to have features

- Simple to install locally; provide a template CodeSpaces repo for web-based
  editing.
- Support a static build: producing a set of view-only HTML files which don't
  need a server for a project, or a single HTML file outside a project.
- An API-only view (Doxygen/Javadoc like feature).

## <a id="specification"></a>Requirements

The requirements expand on the vision by providing additional details.

### <a id="specification-code-blocks-and-doc-blocks"></a>Code blocks and doc blocks

Comments in most programming languages are either inline comments (which are
terminated by a newline) or block comments, which may span multiple lines. In
C/C++, the opening delimiter for an inline comment is `//`. Likewise, `/*` and
`*/` define the opening and closing delimiters for block comments.

This design treats source code on a line-by-line basis. It does not classify at
any deeper granularity -- for example, it does not support a mix of code block
and doc block on the same line.

A code block consists of all lines in a source file which aren't classified as a
doc block. Note that code blocks may consist entirely of a comment, as
illustrated below.

A doc block consists of a comment (inline or block) optionally preceded by
whitespace and optionally succeeded by whitespace. At least one whitespace
character must separate the opening comment delimiter from the doc block text.
Some examples in C:

<pre>void foo(); // This is not a doc block, because these comments are preceded<br>void bar(); // by non-whitespace characters. Instead, they're a code block.<br>//This is not a doc block, because these inline comments lack<br>//whitespace after the opening comment delimiter //. They're also a code block.<br>/*This is not a doc block, because this block comment lacks<br>  whitespace after the opening comment delimiter /*. It's also a code block. */<br>/* This is not a doc block, because non-whitespace <br>   characters follow the closing comment delimiter. <br>   It's also a code block. */ void food();<br><br>// This is a doc block. It has no whitespace preceding the inline<br>// comment delimiters and one character of whitespace following it.<br>  // This is also a doc block. It has two characters of whitespace <br>  // preceding the comment delimiters and one character of whitespace following it.<br>/* This is a doc block. Because it's based on<br>   a block comment, a single comment can span multiple lines. */<br>/* This is also a doc block, even without the visual alignment<br>or a whitespace before the closing comment delimiter.*/<br>  /* This is a doc block<br>     as well. */</pre>

Doc blocks are differentiated by their indent: the whitespace characters
preceding the opening comment delimiter. Adjacent doc blocks with identical
indents are combined into a single, larger doc block.

<pre>// This is all one doc block, since only the preceding<br>//   whitespace (there is none) matters, not the amount of <br>// whitespace following the opening comment delimiters.<br>  // This is the beginning of a different doc<br>  // block, since the indent is different.<br>    // Here's a third doc block; inline and block comments<br>    /* combine as long as the whitespace preceding the comment<br>delimiters is identical. Whitespace inside the comment doesn't affect<br>       the classification. */<br>// These are two separate doc blocks,<br>void foo();<br>// since they are separated by a code block.</pre>

### <a id="implementation-programming-language-support"></a>[Programming language support](index.md#programming-language-support)

Initial targets come from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2022's section on
[programming, scripting, and markup languages](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-technologies-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages)
and IEEE Spectrum's
[Top Programming Languages 2022](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022).

### <a id="specification-ide-integration"></a>IDE/text editor integration

Initial targets come from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2022's section on
[integrated development environments](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-technologies-integrated-development-environment).

There are two basic approaches:

- Sync with current window (simplest): have an additional IDE window open that
  displays the file currently being edited. This requires:
  - Auto-save: the CodeChat Editor autosaves any changes made, to keep files
    synced. Have the host IDE auto-save, so that updates get pushed quickly.
  - Auto-reload: if a the currently-opened file changes, then automatically
    reload it. Have the host IDE do the same.
  - Current file sync: when the current tab changes, update the CodeChat Editor
    with the new file. Ideally, also sync the cursor position.
- Switchable editor (better, complex): provide a command to switch the current
  editor with the CodeChat Editor and vice versa. This requires:
  - To switch from the IDE editor to CodeChat, need to send the text of the
    IDE's editor to CodeChat. For the opposite, need to get the CodeChat Editor
    text and send that to the IDE's editor.
  - Need to preserve the current cursor location across switches. This is harder
    inside a doc block. An approximate find might be a good option.

Additional features:

- Smart navigation: following links to a locally-editable file will open that
  file in the current editor, saving any edits before navigating away. Following
  non-local links opens the file in an external browser.
- Memory: the editor remembers the last cursor location for recently-opened
  files, restoring that on the next file open.

### Zero-build support

The "build" should occur immediately (to any open files) or when when saving a
file (to closed files, which will be updated when they're next opened).
Exception: edits to the TOC are applied only after a save.

### Authoring support

This system should support custom tags to simplify the authoring process. The
GUI must indicate that text enclosed by the tags isn't directly editable,
instead providing an option to edit the underlying tag that produced the text.
When a new tag is inserted, any tag-produced content should be immediately
added.
