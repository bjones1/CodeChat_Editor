Changelog
=========

[Github master](https://github.com/bjones1/CodeChat_Editor)
-----------------------------------------------------------

*   No changes.

Version 0.1.38 -- 2025-Sep-23

    to specify it in the VSCode settings.

-----------------------------

*   The system continues to work after a PC goes to sleep then wakes back up;

    of a websocket and a queue.
